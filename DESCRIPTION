Description: 
	This package performs Weighted Low-Rank Matrix Approximation. 
	The implementation allows to solve the WLRMA problem as well as its convex relaxation.
	Two types of the algorithm are avaliable. The first is based on projected gradient descent and requires 
	to compute some singular value decomposition at each iteration.
	The second is more suitable for high-dimensional data. It is SVD-free and is based on alternating least squares. 
	In addition to the baseline algorithm, the packages contains three build-in acceleration techniques: 
	Nesterov, Anderson and Regularized Anderson acceleration.
